1) Switching between modes and saving changes:
    - configure     <- puts you in configuration mode, you're in operational mode by default
    - exit     <- sends you back a level
    - commit    <- saves changes

    - set vlans <vlan name> vlan-id <id>    <- Creates a vlan with the specified name and id
    - show vlans    <- displays vlans configured on ths switch

3) Creating interface ranges
    - edit interfaces interface-range <range name>      <- puts you in edit mode for the interface range with the given name
                                                            (if no range exists with that name, it creates one)
    - set member-range <start interface> to <end interface>      <- adds the specified interfaces to the range. This commands
                                                                    must be run from within edit mode for an interface range
                                                                    (you have to run the command above immediately before running
                                                                    this one. Use 'exit' to leave edit mode and go back to configuration
                                                                    mode).
